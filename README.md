# Neural Network Viewer

This little project allowed me to experiment on neural networks from scratch.
Indeed, this library only used Boost. It's codded in C++ and is developped with Visual Studio 2018.
The previsualization software uses OpenGL to represent neurons and their links. It permits to view evolution of weight and, when step-by-step mode used, show neurons activity at a fixed moment (if exemples show one-by-one).
